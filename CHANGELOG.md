## [Unreleased 2.2.0] - 2026-02-04

### Added
- Intent-focused tests across orchestrators, transaction manager profit/safety, market data, MEV scanner resilience, nonce manager, and optional live API probes.
- On-chain market data path (Uniswap V2 reserves + ERC20 totalSupply via public RPC) with Binance/Coingecko keyless fallbacks to keep pricing and supply lookups free of API keys.

### Changed
- External API integrations drop CoinMarketCap/CryptoCompare/Infura; rely on public RPC, Binance, and keyless Coingecko, with Etherscan optional.
- README updated (Python 3.10+, clean architecture tree, clarified test commands and public RPC usage).
- `.env.example` refreshed with public Ethereum RPC defaults, Etherscan-only key guidance, and clearer feature toggles (including `RUN_LIVE_API_TESTS`).
- Ignition launcher displays v2.2.0; pyproject dev/test extras modernized for current toolchain.

### Planned
- ON1Builder strategy algorithms
- Additional DEX integrations
- Performance optimizations
- Extended test coverage
